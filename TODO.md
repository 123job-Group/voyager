This Todo list does **not** contain big improvements.  
It only contains small things that came to our minds which we couldn't implement immediately and would be forgotten otherwise.  
Instead, they are listed here:

- ~Move `$globalHub` to a global mixin so it can be called from anywhere~
- Change variables to use kebab-case everywhere
- Rename language-strings like `voyager::bread.browse_name` and `voyager::generic.add_type` to be uniform (use `type` or `name`?)
- DateTimePicker needs a formatting feature
- Improve slidein styling
- Order by relationship
- Remove styling (`voyager-card`) around html-element-formfield
